Snow Leopard Formatting Fix
===========================

SO. For some reason, upgrading to Snow Leopard resulted in all my outgoing AIM messages being sent with a white background. This annoyed me because I'm anal like that. This Adium Plugin fixes that.

Fix Synopsis
============

When this plugin is enabled via the "Format -> Strip BG color from outgoing messages" menu option, the plugin strips "NSBackgroundColor" and whatever AIBodyColorAttributeName resolves to from the NSAttributedString that the outgoing message is built from.

Installation
============

Download from http://github.com/gabrielg/Snow-Leopard-Formatting-Fix/zipball/master

Install the Adium plugin. Double clicking it should just work.
Enable the fix from the format menu.
Enjoy.
