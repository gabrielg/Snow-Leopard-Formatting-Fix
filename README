Snow Leopard Formatting Fix
===========================

SO. For some reason, upgrading to Snow Leopard resulted in all my outgoing AIM messages being sent with a white background. This annoyed me because I'm anal like that. This Adium Plugin fixes that.

Fix Synopsis
============

When this plugin is enabled via the "Format -> Strip BG color from outgoing messages" menu option, the plugin strips "NSBackgroundColor" and whatever AIBodyColorAttributeName resolves to from the NSAttributedString that the outgoing message is built from.

Installation
============
